package inheritance;

//In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:

public class vehicle      {
	
	int speed =90 ;
	 String name ="sai";

	 public  int a =1;
	public void Bikename() {
		
		 
		 System.out.println("the vechicle name is:"+ name);
         
		 
	}
 
}
