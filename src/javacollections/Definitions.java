	 The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.
	 Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.

   Java Collection means a single unit of objects. Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and 
   classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

What is Collection in Java
A Collection represents a single unit of objects, i.e., a group.

    What is a framework in Java
  It provides readymade architecture.
  It represents a set of classes and interfaces.
   It is optional.
   
   List Interface
   
List interface is the child interface of Collection interface. It inhibits a list type data structure in which we can store the ordered collection of objects. 
It can have duplicate values.

List interface is implemented by the classes ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, and Stack.

To instantiate the List interface, we must use :

List <data-type> list1= new ArrayList();  
List <data-type> list2 = new LinkedList();  
List <data-type> list3 = new Vector();  
List <data-type> list4 = new Stack();
