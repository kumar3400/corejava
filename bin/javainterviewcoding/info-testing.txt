Testing are two types defined  1.Functional Testing 2. Non Functional Testing
                                      
                                 *1.Functional Testing*
                               ----------------------------
               

1.Functional Testing:Functional testing is a quality assurance process and a type of black-box testing that bases its test cases on the specifications of the 
software component under test. Functions are tested by feeding them input and examining the output, and internal program structure is rarely considered


2.Smoke testing:Smoke Testing is a kind of Software Testing performed after software build to ascertain that the critical functionalities of the program are working fine.
 It is executed "before" any detailed functional or regression tests are executed on the software build. 

3.Sanity Testing:Sanity testing is a kind of Software Testing performed after receiving a software build, with minor changes in code, or functionality, to ascertain that

 the bugs have been fixed and no further issues are introduced due to these changes.
 The goal is to determine that the proposed functionality works roughly as expected. 
If sanity test fails, the build is rejected to save the time and costs involved in a more rigorous testing.

4.Regression Testing:Regression Testing is defined as a type of software testing to confirm that a recent program or code change has not adversely affected existing 
features. Regression Testing is nothing but a full or partial selection of already executed test cases which are re-executed to ensure existing functionalities work
 fine.

5.black box Testing:BLACK BOX TESTING, also known as Behavioral Testing, is a software testing method in which the internal structure/design/implementation of 
the item being tested is not known to the tester. These tests can be functional or non-functional, though usually functional.

6.Whiteboxtesting:-WHITE BOX TESTING (also known as Clear Box Testing, Open Box Testing, Glass Box Testing, Transparent Box Testing, Code-Based Testing or Structural 
Testing) is a software testing method in which the internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is known to the tester.

7.unit testing:-UNIT TESTING is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. 
The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few 
inputs and usually a single output.

8.GUI Testing:GUI testing is defined as the process of testing the system's Graphical User Interface of the Application Under Test. 
GUI testing involves checking the screens with the controls like menus, buttons, icons, and all types of bars - toolbar, menu bar, dialog boxes, and windows, etc.

9.Gray-box testing:- (International English spelling: grey-box testing) is a combination of white-box testing and black-box testing. 
The aim of this testing is to search for the defects if any due to improper structure or improper usage of applications.[1][2

10.Monkey Testing:- is defined as the kind of testing that deals with random inputsIn Monkey Testing the tester (sometimes developer too) is considered as the 'Monkey'
If a monkey uses a computer he will randomly perform any task on the system out of his understanding
Just like the tester will apply random test cases on the system under test to find bugs/errors without predefining any test case

11.GorillaTesting:-Gorilla Testing is a Software testing technique wherein a module of the program is repeatedly tested to ensure that it is working correctly and
 there is no bug in that module.
A module can be tested over a hundred times, and in the same manner. So, Gorilla Testing is also known as "Frustrating Testing".

12.End to End testing:-
End-to-end testing is a technique used to test whether the flow of an application right from start to finish is behaving as expected.
 The purpose of performing end-to-end testing is to identify system dependencies and to ensure that the data integrity is maintained between various
 system components and systems.
13.Ad hoc testing:-is a commonly used term for software testing performed without planning and documentation, but can be applied to early scientific 
experimental studies. The tests are intended to be run only once, unless a defect is discovered. Ad hoc testing is the least formal test method

14.DataBasetesting:-
Database Testing is checking the schema, tables, triggers, etc. of the database under test. 
It may involve creating complex queries to load/stress test the database and check its responsiveness. It Checks data integrity and consistency.

15.UserAcceptance Testing(UAT):-
User Acceptance is defined as a type of testing performed by the Client to certify the system with respect to the requirements that was agreed upon.
 This testing happens in the final phase of testing before moving the software application to the Market or Production environment.

16)alpha Testing:-Alpha Testing is a type of software testing performed to identify bugs before releasing the product to real users or to the public.
 Alpha Testing is one of the user acceptance testing

17)Beta Testing:-Beta Testing is performed by real users of the software application in a real environment. Beta testing is one of the type of User Acceptance Testing.

                                        *------------------------*




2.Non-Functional Testing:-
Non-functional testing is defined as a type of Software testing to check non-functional aspects (performance, usability, reliability, etc)
 of a software application. It is designed to test the readiness of a system as per nonfunctional parameters which are never addressed by functional testing.
An excellent example of non-functional test would be to check how many people can simultaneously login into a software.
Non-functional testing is equally important as functional testing and affects client satisfaction.

1)Performance Testing:-
Performance Testing is defined as a type of software testing to ensure software applications will perform well under their expected workload.

performance  test tools are 1.Hp LoadRunner 2.Jmeter

The focus of Performance Testing is checking a software program's
Speed - Determines whether the application responds quickly
Scalability - Determines maximum user load the software application can handle.
Stability - Determines if the application is stable under varying loads



2.Load Testing:-Load testing is a kind of Performance Testing which determines a system's performance under real-life load conditions. This
 testing helps determine how the application behaves when multiple users access it simultaneously.

3.volume Testing:-
Volume testing is defined as a type of Software Testing, where the software is subjected to a huge volume of data.
 It is also referred to as flood testing. Volume testing is done to analyze the system performance by increasing the volume of data in the database.

4.Security Testing:-
Security Testing is defined as a type of Software Testing that ensures software systems and applications are free from any vulnerabilities,
 threats, risks that may cause a big loss. Security testing of any system is about finding all possible loopholes and weaknesses of the 
system which might result into a loss of information, revenue, repute at the hands of the employees or outsiders of the Organization.
